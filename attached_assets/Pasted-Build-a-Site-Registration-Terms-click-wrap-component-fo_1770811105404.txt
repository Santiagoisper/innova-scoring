Build a “Site Registration Terms” click-wrap component for Innova Trials LLC (Florida, Miami) to be used on a Site Registration web form.

Goal
- Present a legally robust click-wrap agreement for clinical research sites registering with Innova Trials LLC.
- The user MUST actively accept the terms before the form can be submitted.
- Acceptance must be stored with strong evidence (timestamp, IP, user agent, terms version, and full terms text hash).

UI/UX Requirements (Conspicuous + Enforceable)
1) Show a heading: “Innova Trials LLC – Site Registration Terms (Click-Wrap Agreement)”.
2) Show a short preface line above the checkbox:
   “By submitting this registration, you represent that you are duly authorized to act on behalf of the Site and to legally bind the Site to these Terms.”
3) Display the full Terms text in a scrollable container (recommended) OR a clearly visible “View Terms” link that opens a modal with the full Terms. Prefer the scrollable container on the same page.
4) Add an unchecked checkbox (not pre-checked) with label:
   “I have read, understood, and agree to the Innova Trials LLC Disclaimer, Acknowledgment, and Site Registration Terms.”
5) Disable the “Submit Registration” button until the checkbox is checked.
6) If the user attempts to submit without checking, show an inline error message.

Data & Evidence Logging Requirements
- On submit, record:
  - accepted: true
  - accepted_at_utc: ISO timestamp
  - ip_address
  - user_agent
  - terms_version (e.g., "1.0")
  - terms_effective_date (e.g., "2026-02-11")
  - terms_text (store full text or store a strong hash + immutable reference; ideally store both)
  - terms_text_sha256
  - registrant_name, registrant_email, site_name (from form)
- Store this acceptance record in a database (SQLite acceptable for MVP; Prisma/Postgres ok too).
- Provide an admin page / endpoint to view acceptance records.

Email Confirmation (Proof Enhancement)
- After successful submit, send an email confirmation to the registrant that includes:
  - submission date/time (UTC)
  - terms version
  - terms effective date
  - statement that they agreed via checkbox click-wrap
(If email integration is heavy, implement as a stub function with clear TODO and log the email payload.)

Tech Stack Preference
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript.
- Use a simple form page: /register
- Use an API route to save acceptance: /api/register
- Use SQLite via Prisma for persistence (or any straightforward DB approach).
- Ensure server-side capture of IP and user agent.

The Terms Text (must be inserted verbatim)
